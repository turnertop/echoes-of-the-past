            The artwork "Echoes of the Past" is an interactive installation that aims to immerse the audience in the world of a patient with dementia, in the third stage of Alzheimer's. The goals are to raise awareness for Alzheimer's and dementia and engage the audience to reflect upon the experience.

            The installation features several interactive elements such as a fast-running clock, a video input/output mirror that simulates hallucinations, obscure objects and a television with looped videos. The main interaction of the installation is through the television, which is an example of Dieter Daniels' interaction with a closed data world.

The artwork follows the use of installation as a medium which continues the trend within contemporary art towards immersive experiences. The use of a television with looped videos to simulate a patient with dementia experiencing effects like memory loss is connected to new media art through the use of digital technology as an artistic medium. The themes of memory and time can be connected to movements like Surrealism in modernist art movements that represent subjective experiences in the human psyche.

         <p className="text-black text-2xl text-center max-w-3xl mt-2" style={{fontFamily: 'Montserrat'}}>
In our artwork, we drew inspiration from a range of sources which tell complete stories with intricate details and hidden messages.
        </p>

         <p className="text-black text-2xl text-center max-w-3xl mt-2" style={{fontFamily: 'Montserrat'}}>
"The Man Who Flew Into Space From His Apartment" by Ilya Kabakov was a main inspiration in terms of the installation aspect of creating a room to immerse the audience into our message and experience.
        </p>
<p className="text-black text-2xl text-center max-w-3xl mt-2" style={{fontFamily: 'Montserrat'}}>
"Everywhere at the End of Time" by Caretaker is an album that depicts someone descending through the stages of Alzheimer's. The immersion of a slow descent was an inspiration but we wanted to focus on stage three of Alzheimer's rather than all of the stages.
        </p>
<p className="text-black text-2xl text-center max-w-3xl mt-2" style={{fontFamily: 'Montserrat'}}>
Amigo and Amigo's "Affinity" resonates with us as it uses light installations to convey the experience of memory loss, creating a powerful emotional impact on the audience through technology.
